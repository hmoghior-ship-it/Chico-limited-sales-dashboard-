This is an analysis of sales for chico limited company showing how different state performed in sales.
FINDINGS, STEPS TAKEN AND RECOMMENDATION.


From the date set provided for me, i created different pivolt tables to be able to show performace of different section to ascertain where performed best and least. I further used pivolt chart to give easy illustrations for easy visualisation. i created a dashbroad with all the informations.

The category with the highest total sale is office supplies with 2,089,510 followed by electronice with 2,054,456 then lastly furnitures with 2,038,673 but there is a slight difference in profit as office supplies retain its position of been highest with a profit of 551,575 while furniture with 540,542 and electronics with 518,580. This shows that profit is not determined by the total amount of sales.  

Over the years profit trend has not been stable. It rose and fell at different month in different years. At the start of the business in 2020-03 the profit was at 22,991 this rose in 2020-04 to 133,385 and in 2020-05 profit went down to 113,287.The profit was up and down when it hits its lowest in 2021-01 with a figure of 22,187 then the company had a breakthrough in 2022-12 with a profit of 204,412. we also acknowlegde that the quantity affects the profit and not the sale.

The state that peforms more in sales is Newyork with a sale of 1,130,048 and the least is ohio with 884,768. also ohio got the least profits with 216519 with a quantity of 2041 while llinois with a profit of 240372 with quantity of 1820,

city with the highest sales is orlando with 452,158 and columbus has the lowest with 246,692. we should note that its not about the quantity. some state sold less quantity but made more profit, for instance, florida sold 2145 products but made the highest profit of 308,706 while newyork that sold the highest quantity of products made proftit of 308,806.

I recommend that more products be given to areas that could make more profit with less quantity of products this will boost sales.
